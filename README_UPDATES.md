# Nexobotics RAG Chatbot - Updates Summary

I've made several improvements to your chatbot system to optimize it for customer service with RAG. Here's a summary of the changes:

## 1. Frontend Updates (chatbot.js)

- **Added Session Management**: The chatbot now generates a unique session ID and stores it in localStorage, providing conversation continuity across page reloads
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added more specific error messages and a connection error UI component with retry functionality
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Added fallback images for when logos can't be loaded
- **Backend Connection Check**: Added a health check on initialization to verify backend availability
- **Exposed Debug Interface**: Added window.nexoChatbot for easier debugging in the browser console

## 2. Backend Updates (index.py)

- **RAG-Only Mode**: Modified the backend to always use RAG rather than switching between RAG and non-RAG
- **Simplified Error Handling**: Removed the complex fallback to non-RAG mode, instead using friendly error messages
- **Improved Session Handling**: Better support for the session_id parameter from frontend

## 3. RAG Pipeline Updates (rag_pipeline.py)

- **Customer Service Optimizations**:
  - Improved the prompt template to be more customer service oriented
  - Added specific instructions for tone and style
  - Reduced temperature for more factual/consistent responses
  - Updated error messages to be more customer-friendly

## 4. Additional Documentation

- **WEBSITE_INTEGRATION.md**: Detailed guide for integrating the chatbot into your website
- **USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Instructions for maintaining and updating the knowledge base

## Testing Your Updated System

1. **Start the server**:

   ```
   python groq-3/api/index.py
   ```

2. **Open your website** or test it by creating a simple HTML file:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>Chatbot Test</title>
       <script src="groq-3/website/chatbot.js"></script>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Chatbot Test Page</h1>
       <!-- The chatbot will automatically appear in the corner -->
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Ask customer service questions** related to the information in your knowledge base

## Next Steps

1. **Update Knowledge Base**: Add your actual business information to the persistent_add_docs.py file and run it
2. **Customize Styling**: Modify the colors and styling in the ChatbotWidget constructor
3. **Set Up Production Deployment**: Configure CORS and authentication for production use
4. **Monitor & Improve**: Add logging to identify common questions and knowledge gaps
